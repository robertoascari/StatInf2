The report expires after one year from the end of the course.\nThe final grade is obtained as the sum of the above scores.\n\n\n\nMock exam\nAn example of written examination is provided at this link."

    "text": "Acknowledgments\nThe primary source of this website’s content are the textbooks Azzalini and Scarpa (2011) and Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009). A few pictures have been taken from the textbooks; in these cases the original source is cited.\nI have made use of several other books, scientific articles, and datasets to complement the main textbooks. They are all cited at the end of each unit. Students are encouraged to consult the books: these slides are just a concise summary.\nI am also grateful to Aldo Solari, who gracefully shared the material of the courses Data Mining and Statistical Learning. These websites have been used to lay the basis of this course.\nAll the mistakes still present are mine."
